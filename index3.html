                            <p>SoFi Technologies began as a student loan refinancing company but has evolved into a comprehensive digital financial services provider. The company offers a wide range of products including personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, insurance, and investment services through its mobile-first platform.</p>
                            <p>After going public via a SPAC merger in 2021, SoFi has continued to expand its offerings and user base. A significant milestone was obtaining a national bank charter, which has allowed the company to function more like a traditional bank with lower funding costs and more service options.</p>
